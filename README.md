# AngularSpringBoot
This is a full stack application with Angular and Spring Boot. The frontend Angular code is the directory todoj, the backend Spring Boot code is in the directory of restful-web-service. The Angular Modules, Components, Data Binding and Routing are all developed in this project, and  the challenges of Connecting an Angular Frontend to a RESTful API is also solved. I Build RESTful APIs with Spring Boot and use Spring Security to configure Basic Authentication and JWT. In the development, Auto Configuration and Spring Initializer are used together with a variety of Spring Boot Starter Projects - Spring Boot Web, and Spring Boot Data JPA.
